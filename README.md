# Cpp_Image-video_Processing
A project that applies an image algorithm to a video for better focus.

This is a wellknown project in our days, where two cameras (or more) with different depth of field are combined to make a better and higher quality image.

In this project I took two images, one in close focus (macro) and in far focus (normal or inf), then I combined these two photo with an image selection algorithm to take the best focused parts of every image to a final image with the optimal focus.
