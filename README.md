# Cpp_Image-video_Processing
A project that applies an image algorithm to a video for better focus.

This is a wellknown project in our days, where two cameras (or more) with different depth of field are combined to make a better quality image.

In this project I use two images, the first one in close focus (macro) and the second in far focus (normal or inf), then I combined them with an image selection algorithm to aquire the better focused parts of every image to a final image with optimal focus.

Example images:
Left image in close focus, right in far focus

Left image the "bad focus parts", right the output image

Here is a girls photo, I blur a region in every picture and then I left the algorithm do the job
